// A timetable is a workflow-level setting, not a node, and until now the
// builder could only tell the user to go and set one. "Every morning at 9"
// is the single most common thing a workflow is asked to do, so a build for
// it ended with a manual trigger and a chore -- and the chore carried a trap:
// the schedule is stored in UTC, so "9 am" typed as 0 9 * * * fires at 2:30
// pm in India.
//
// The model names the time the way the user said it, in the user's own
// timezone, and the server does the conversion. The conversion mirrors the
// Workflows page's cadenceToCron (frontend/src/lib/cronCadence.ts) exactly --
// the same three cadences, the same anchoring on today's date -- so a
// schedule the builder set is one the Schedule picker can read back and
// edit. Keep the two in step.
