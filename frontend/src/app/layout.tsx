// Self-hosted rather than next/font/google, which fetches from
// fonts.gstatic.com at BUILD time. Two reasons, and the second is the real one:
//
//  1. The build stops depending on network reachability. A CDN outage or an
//     offline machine currently fails `next build` outright.
//  2. This bundle is also served from inside the native Android shell, off the
//     device, with no server in front of it. An app whose typography depends on
//     reaching Google is an app that renders wrong on a train.
//
// These are the same Geist files -- the `geist` package is already a
// dependency, and the variable faces cover every weight in one file each, just
// as the Google-hosted versions do.

// this with the .am-safe-* classes in responsive.css.

        A meta tag rather than a header because there is no server: the bundle
        is files on the device, served by the WebView itself, so a header has
        nobody to set it. The web app is behind Vercel and gets its own headers,
        which is why this is gated on IS_NATIVE -- a build-time constant, so the
        tag is absent from the web bundle entirely rather than merely inert.

        lib/api.ts reads it: connect-src has to name the actual backend this
