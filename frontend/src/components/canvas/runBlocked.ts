// they are being pointed at will not help them. And a read-only viewer cannot
// deploy at all, so naming deployment as the next step is advice they cannot
// take.
//
// Pure and framework-free so the whole table is unit-testable, which matters
// here: this is messaging logic, and messaging is exactly the kind of thing
